Java programs have at least one class and one main() method.
Each class represents one real-world idea.
The main() method runs the tasks of the program.
Java comments add helpful context to human readers.
Java has whitespace, curly braces, and semicolons.
Whitespace is for humans to read code easily.
Curly braces mark the scope of a class and method.
Semicolons mark the end of a statement.
Java is a compiled language.
Compiling catches mistakes in our code.
Compilers transform code into an executable class.
